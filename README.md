## Description
This app tracks a user's workout progress using a Mongo database, Mongoose schema, and routes handled by Express. A user is able to view, create, and track daily workouts. They can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the distance traveled can be tracked. 

They can add exercises to the most recent workout plan, or add new exercises to a new workout plan. When the users clicks on the dashboard, they can view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts, and view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts.
